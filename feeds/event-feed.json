Chains on all competitors’ bikes will be removed prior to the race, requiring riders to use their skills to maintain their speed on the trail.

There are Men's Open and Master 40+, Women's Open and Junior classes.<br><span class=\"heading-three\"><br><br>What kind of equipment do I need?</span><br>Downhill racing is demanding on both body and bike. Like any sport, being prepared physically and utilizing the proper equipment is essential for success. It is highly recommended that your bike have a minimum of 6 inches of travel, functional disc brakes on both wheels, and specific to aggressive downhill type use. Bikes must be in good working condition and may be rejected by race officials if deemed unfit for use in this event. We advise that you have your equipment checked by a certified mechanic prior to use in the bike park.<br><span class=\"heading-three\"><br><br>How much does it cost to race?</span><br>For competitors who have a Steamboat Bike Park pass the entry fee is $30.

No licenses or additional fees/memberships are required to compete in this specific event.<br><span class=\"heading-three\"><br><br>How should I prepare?</span><br>There's no way around it...downhill racing does have some inherent risks associated with the sport.

This means ensuring that your bike is properly maintained, that you're wearing the recommended protective gear, that you're comfortable with the race course and confident in your ability to ride it, as well as knowing your limits and riding in control at all times.

It’s his first time putting his long-running, popular string band, Trampled by Turtles, on hiatus to focus all of his efforts on a more personal project. It’s his first time speaking so plainly and literally about something happening in his private life. And it’s his first time dedicating an entire record to a single topic — a topic so significant and intimate that he questioned whether or not he should even release it into the world.<br><br>There is palpable sadness and moments of poignant reflection, to be sure, but “Furnace” also propels Simonett forward with an undeniable sense of newfound freedom. At some points, like on the upbeat third track, “Red Wing Blue Wing,” you could describe the music as downright rollicking.<br><br>Simonett rounded up his longtime friends from the Minneapolis roots rock scene — drummer JT Bates, guitarist Erik Koskinen, bassist Tim Saxhaug (also of Trampled by Turtles) and pianist Bryan Nichols — to record the album live to tape. The five of them holed up in the historic Pachyderm Studio in Cannon Falls, Minn., a ski chalet-like studio nestled deep in the woods where legendary albums like Nirvana’s “In Utero” were recorded.","ImageLink":"/-/media/steamboat/summer-images/events/desktop/dead_man_winter_press_photo.ashx","EventLink":"/en/things-to-do/events/steamboat-mountain-music-free-concert-august-18"},{"Title":"10K at 10,000 Feet Trail Run","Link":"/things-to-do/events/steamboat-springs-running-series-10k","StartDate":"2017-09-03T10:00:00-05:00","EndDate":"2017-09-03T13:00:00-05:00","IsAllDay":false,"LocationName":"Rabbit Ears Pass Summit","LocationAddress":"Rabbit Ears Pass, Colorado 80459","Latitude":"","Longitude":"","Tags":null,"Description":"A challenging trail run with some beautiful terrain and breathtaking scenery, this race is a Steamboat classic!

You’d be forgiven at the time for expecting it to be something of a side project. Chris Wood already had legions of devoted fans for his incomparable work as one-third of Medeski Martin &amp; Wood, while his brother Oliver toured with Tinsley Ellis before releasing a half-dozen albums with his band King Johnson. Almost a decade later and with drummer Jano Rix added as a permanent third member, it’s become quite clear that The Wood Brothers is indeed the main act.<br><br>“Paradise,” an album about longing and desire and the ways in which the pursuit of fulfillment can keep it perpetually out of our reach, is The Wood Brothers’ most sophisticated work to date and also their most rocking, with bassist Chris Wood playing electric on tracks for the first time. Recorded at Dan Auerbach’s Easy Eye studio in Nashville, “Paradise” captures the latest chapter in the ongoing evolution of a band—and a family—navigating the joys and challenges of a life in music.<br><br>“Paradise” follows the band’s acclaimed 2013 release “The Muse,” which was recorded almost entirely live around a tree of microphones in Zac Brown’s Southern Ground studio. Hailed previously by the New York Times for their “gripping” vocals and by the LA Times for their “taught musicianship,” the live setting proved to be a remarkable showcase for the brothers’ live chemistry and charismatic magnetism. Taking a different approach to their sixth studio album, the decision to record in Nashville was no coincidence, as “Paradise” marks the first album written with the entire band living in Music City.<br>","ImageLink":"/-/media/steamboat/summer-images/events/desktop/woodbrothers.ashx","EventLink":"/en/things-to-do/events/the-wood-brothers"},{"Title":"Town Challenge Sunshine Loop XC Bike Race","Link":"/things-to-do/events/town-challenge-sunshine","StartDate":"2017-08-16T17:00:00-05:00","EndDate":"2017-08-16T20:00:00-05:00","IsAllDay":false,"LocationName":"Steamboat Resort","LocationAddress":"2305 Mt.

During their twenty-five plus years as a band they have headlined shows and festivals from coast to coast, released nine albums, and maintained a vibrant, relevant and influential voice in the music world. The evolution of Leftover Salmon’s music is influenced by Leftover Salmon co-founders Drew Emmitt (mandolin/vocals) and Vince Herman‘s (guitar/singer) keen musical instincts, and follows a musical path that adheres to the deep tradition the duo started when they first formed the group along with deceased banjo player Mark Vann. The addition of new band members over the years has nurtured an unmistakable evolution and freshness in Leftover Salmon’s sound, and has added an edge to the long-lasting power of the band’s music. Fueled by the rhythm section of long time bassist Greg Garrison, drummer Alwyn Robinson, and Salmon’s newest member, keyboardist Erik Deustch, the band is currently enjoying a creative renaissance. The front line trio of Emmitt, Herman and prodigious banjo player Andy Thorn are continually challenged and pushed in new directions as the band collectively searches for new spaces and sounds within their extensive catalog of songs.","ImageLink":"/-/media/snowshoe/event-images/leftoversalmon1800.ashx","EventLink":"/en/things-to-do/events/botb-leftover-salmon"},{"Title":"Beats on the Basin: Qiet","Link":"","StartDate":"2017-08-19T19:30:00-05:00","EndDate":"2017-08-19T22:00:00-05:00","IsAllDay":false,"LocationName":"Snowshoe Mountain Resort","LocationAddress":"10 Snowshoe Drive, Snowshoe, WV 26209","Latitude":"","Longitude":"","Tags":null,"Description":"<span>Qiet is the culmination of this wild and wondrous world, infused with every culture on the planet and refined in the mountains of West Virginia.Their songs radiate an undeniable energy, passionate lyrics and humor dark as coal.

Of course you can chose to ride less than all four days, but to truly experience the beauty of Vermont and this event, we strongly urge you to ride with us for two or more days.<br><br><a href=\"https://www.bikereg.com/the-vermont-challenge\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"linkbtnflash\">Register now</a><br><br><span class=\"heading-alt\"><br>In the news</span><br><br><span class=\"heading-three\">One of the 8 rides of your life</span><br>Vermont Ski &amp; Ride just named the Vermont Challenge \"One of the 8 rides of your life.\" <a href=\"http://vtskiandride.com/8-bike-rides-life/\" target=\"_blank\">Read more</a>.<br><br><span class=\"heading-three\">top 10 must do rides in 2017</span><br>Under Armour &amp; MapMyRide include The Vermont Challenge in its <a href=\"http://blog.mapmyrun.com/10-must-bike-rides-2017/7/\" target=\"_blank\">TOP 10 MUST DO RIDES in 2017</a>!</span><br>","ImageLink":"/-/media/stratton/images/summer/1800x1012/events/2015-16/vermont-challenge/161217_vtchallenge_1800x1012_4.ashx","EventLink":"/en/things-to-do/events/the-vermont-challenge"},{"Title":"Three Dog night","Link":"","StartDate":"2017-08-19T18:00:00-05:00","EndDate":"2017-08-19T00:00:00-05:00","IsAllDay":false,"LocationName":"Stratton Mountain Base Area","LocationAddress":"5 Village Lodge Rd, South Londonderry, VT 05155","Latitude":"43.113819","Longitude":"-72.905090","Tags":null,"Description":"<span class=\"heading-three\">Three Dog Night</span><br><span class=\"paragraph-two\">Grammy-nominated music legends take the mountain stage with their Billboard #1 hits “Joy to the World,” “One,” “Mama Told Me (Not to Come)” and many more iconic tunes for a weekend of mountain music and cycling at the <a></a><a href=\"~/link.aspx?_id=4BB6D8B9CFA04B2AB11D93CA4DDB6397&amp;_z=z\">Vermont Challenge</a>.<br><br><br><span>Stratton Mountain Music is presented by Stratton Magazine &amp; Manchester Life Magazine</span><br><br><span class=\"heading-three\">TIMES</span><br>Doors open - 5pm<br>Three Dog Night - 6pm<br><span class=\"heading-three\"></span><span><br><span class=\"heading-three\">GENERAL ADMISSION TICKETS</span><br>$25 Advance | $30 Day of concert tickets available at the ticket window.Children 10 &amp; under are free with adult ticket holder.<br><br><a href=\"https://book.stratton.com/ecomm/shop/activities/2624338/en-US/?startdate=2017-08-19&amp;adultcount=1&amp;childCount=0&amp;productsupercategoryId=2\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"linkbtnflash\">Book Now</a><br><br><span class=\"heading-three\">CONCERT LODGING WITH TICKET FOR JUST $89* PER PERSON</span><br>Enjoy an evening of music under the stars with lodging just a short stroll away.
