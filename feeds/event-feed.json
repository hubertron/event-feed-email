It’s his first time putting his long-running, popular string band, Trampled by Turtles, on hiatus to focus all of his efforts on a more personal project. It’s his first time speaking so plainly and literally about something happening in his private life. And it’s his first time dedicating an entire record to a single topic — a topic so significant and intimate that he questioned whether or not he should even release it into the world.<br><br>There is palpable sadness and moments of poignant reflection, to be sure, but “Furnace” also propels Simonett forward with an undeniable sense of newfound freedom. At some points, like on the upbeat third track, “Red Wing Blue Wing,” you could describe the music as downright rollicking.<br><br>Simonett rounded up his longtime friends from the Minneapolis roots rock scene — drummer JT Bates, guitarist Erik Koskinen, bassist Tim Saxhaug (also of Trampled by Turtles) and pianist Bryan Nichols — to record the album live to tape. The five of them holed up in the historic Pachyderm Studio in Cannon Falls, Minn., a ski chalet-like studio nestled deep in the woods where legendary albums like Nirvana’s “In Utero” were recorded.","ImageLink":"/-/media/steamboat/summer-images/events/desktop/dead_man_winter_press_photo.ashx","EventLink":"/en/things-to-do/events/steamboat-mountain-music-free-concert-august-18"},{"Title":"Movies on the Mountain","Link":"/things-to-do/events/movies-on-the-mountain-july-8","StartDate":"2017-08-19T20:15:00-05:00","EndDate":"2017-08-19T23:00:00-05:00","IsAllDay":false,"LocationName":"Gondola Square","LocationAddress":"2305 Mt.

During their twenty-five plus years as a band they have headlined shows and festivals from coast to coast, released nine albums, and maintained a vibrant, relevant and influential voice in the music world. The evolution of Leftover Salmon’s music is influenced by Leftover Salmon co-founders Drew Emmitt (mandolin/vocals) and Vince Herman‘s (guitar/singer) keen musical instincts, and follows a musical path that adheres to the deep tradition the duo started when they first formed the group along with deceased banjo player Mark Vann. The addition of new band members over the years has nurtured an unmistakable evolution and freshness in Leftover Salmon’s sound, and has added an edge to the long-lasting power of the band’s music. Fueled by the rhythm section of long time bassist Greg Garrison, drummer Alwyn Robinson, and Salmon’s newest member, keyboardist Erik Deustch, the band is currently enjoying a creative renaissance. The front line trio of Emmitt, Herman and prodigious banjo player Andy Thorn are continually challenged and pushed in new directions as the band collectively searches for new spaces and sounds within their extensive catalog of songs.","ImageLink":"/-/media/snowshoe/event-images/leftoversalmon1800.ashx","EventLink":"/en/things-to-do/events/botb-leftover-salmon"},{"Title":"FreeFall Festival","Link":"","StartDate":"2017-09-01T00:00:00-05:00","EndDate":"2017-09-03T23:30:00-05:00","IsAllDay":true,"LocationName":"Snowshoe Mountain Resort","LocationAddress":"10 Snowshoe Drive, Snowshoe, WV 26209","Latitude":"","Longitude":"","Tags":["Concerts Live Music","Annual","On Mountain"],"Description":"Welcome to FreeFall!
